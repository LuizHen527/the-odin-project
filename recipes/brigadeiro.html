        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>The brigadeiro is a beloved Brazilian sweet treat, often considered the country’s most iconic dessert. Made from a simple mixture of condensed milk, cocoa powder, butter, and chocolate sprinkles, it has a smooth, fudgy texture that melts in your mouth. The mixture is cooked until thickened, then rolled into small balls and coated with sprinkles, giving it a rich, chocolatey flavor with a hint of caramel sweetness. Its simplicity and irresistible taste make it a favorite at celebrations and family gatherings.</p>

It’s a symbol of joy, affection, and shared moments — a must-have at birthday parties and festive occasions. Whether served in tiny paper cups, spooned from a jar, or reinvented in gourmet versions, the brigadeiro captures the essence of Brazilian hospitality and love for sweets, uniting generations around one bite of happiness.</p>
