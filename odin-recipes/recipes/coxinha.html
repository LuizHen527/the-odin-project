    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>The coxinha is one of Brazil’s most popular savory snacks, easily recognized by its teardrop shape. Its dough is typically made from wheat flour and chicken broth, giving it a soft texture and mild flavor. On the outside, it’s coated in breadcrumbs and deep-fried until golden and crispy, creating an irresistible crust that contrasts beautifully with the creamy, flavorful filling inside. Traditionally, the filling consists of shredded chicken seasoned with onions, garlic, and herbs — sometimes mixed with catupiry or cream cheese — resulting in a rich and comforting bite.</p>

    <p>More than just a snack, the coxinha holds a special place in Brazilian food culture. Found in parties, bakeries, and snack bars across the country, it’s a symbol of convenience and delight that pleases all tastes. Its versatility has also inspired countless variations, with fillings like dried beef, cheese, jackfruit, and even vegetarian or vegan versions. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and bursting with flavor, the coxinha stands as a true icon of Brazilian cuisine — a delicious blend of tradition, creativity, and the nation’s love for good food.</p>

                <li>Let the filling cool completely before shaping the coxinhas.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

                <li>Remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>Shape the coxinhas:

                <li>Take a small piece of dough and roll it into a ball (about the size of a golf ball).</li>
                <li>Flatten it in your hand to form a small disk.</li>
                <li>Place a spoonful of filling in the center, then close and shape it into a teardrop (pointed at the top).</li>

            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>Bread the coxinhas:
            <ol>
                <li>Dip each shaped coxinha into the beaten eggs.</li>
                <li>Roll it in bread crumbs until evenly coated.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

                <li>Remove and drain on paper towels.</li>
